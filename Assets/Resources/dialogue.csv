tut1,"It smelled like a normal day, with the scent of opportunity",Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,"It felt like a normal summer day, with clear blue skies painted...",Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,But this day was most unlike all the rest.,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,"You, slave girl, what's your name?","Lisia, Servant Manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,,System,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,Today was the day I would become king!,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,"Good. Now, there's just the small matter of the entry fee.","Lisia, Servant Manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1,Pay 5 gold or Refuse?,DecisionCard,"Pay 5 gold	","Refuse	",tut1a,tut1a,,,,,,,,,"Lisia, Servant Manager",
tut1a,"Right, you're officially a servant. Duties include cleaning, bowing, and not asking questions. The King wants to see you.","Lisia, Servant Manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1a,He's inside. Don’t keep him waiting,Guard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut1a,Your Majesty? May I enter?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut2
tut2,"Ah, the new servant! Perfect timing. See that thing stuck outside the window? Get it for me.",King,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2,Climb or Improvise?,DecisionCard,Climb out the window,Improvise,tut2a,tut2a,,,,,,,,,King,
tut2a,"Ah, good effort. Now, just hand it",King,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH,King,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,You stare out the window. The river carries the King away. No body. No witnesses.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,Except you.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,Oh. Oh no.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut3
tut3, What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,Deep breath. Walk to the door. Open it. Casually inform the guards that His Majesty has—,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,"No. Bad idea. ""Hi, the King fell out a window"" is not a great opening line.",You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,Maybe I could… flee the castle? Reinvent myself as a wandering poet? Do people tip poets?,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3, I could tie all the curtains together and rappel down the castle wall. Dignified. Graceful. Probably ends with me in the moat.,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,"""Ahem.""",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3, …Who. Was. That?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut4
tut4,"Well, well. A fascinating situation. A missing King. A nervous servant. A witness.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,A witness?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,"He steps out from behind the curtain, smoothing his robes. ""Yes. Me. Lucky you!",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,…Is it?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,"Absolutely! You see, I could alert the guards. They might believe I had nothing to do with this. Or…",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,Or?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,Or you do one little favor for me instead. A minor thing. Barely worth mentioning.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut5
tut5,You can pretend to be the King.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5,How do you respond?,DecisionCard,That’s illegal!,That sounds like a terrible idea.,tut5a,tut5a,,,,,,,,,Vizier,
tut5a,"Nonsense! Your blood matches, so with a little magic—"" He pulls out a suspiciously glowing wand. ""—you’ll be him.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,I don’t know how to be king. Why don’t you do it?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,"I have the wrong blood. But don’t worry—I’ll guide you. It'll be like a puppet show, one where the puppet has taxes to collect",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,What do you get out of this?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,I think it'll be... fun!,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut6
tut6,"First order of business—covering up your, uh… previous self’s unfortunate defenestration.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"Yes. That. Very tragic. How do we, uh… do that?",You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,Simple. We need a story. Something believable. Something the people will accept without question.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,Oh! Like ‘She ran away to follow her dream of becoming a wandering poet’?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"Creative, but if we start telling people servants have dreams, we’ll have a revolution by lunchtime.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"So, two options. One, we blame a local thief. People love a good thief-burning. Or two, we erase her family from the history books entirely. You know, if you didn’t like them.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,How do you cover it up?,DecisionCard,Blame a local thief. Everyone hates thieves.,"Erase all members of my…her family. If I didn’t like them, they never existed.",tut6a,tut6b,,,,,,,,,Vizier,
tut6a,"Ah yes, the old ‘random thief did it’ strategy. A classic. Next, we’ll say the royal treasury was stolen by ‘an unfortunate accounting error.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut7
tut6b,"Erasing an entire bloodline. A bold move! Some would call it tyranny, but I call it... interior decorating for the royal family tree.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut7
tut7,"Now, onto the actual business of ruling. It’s quite simple. Keep people divided, distracted, and just happy enough not to riot.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut7,"Right now, we’re creating a new religion. One with just enough commandments to make people argue, but not enough to be useful.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut7,Branching Choice,DecisionCard,Let’s tweak the new religion. Faith should be a bit more… profitable.,I’d rather disrupt society with catchy tunes. Let’s explore the music plan.,tut8a,tut8b,,,,,,,,,,
tut8a,Welcome to the Department of Theological Adjustments. Religion: now with 30% more flexibility and 100% more arguing.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8a,Shouldn’t religion be about faith?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8a,"Faith is fine. But organized faith? That’s where the real magic happens. Also, the tax benefits are incredible.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8a,"Your Majesty, we need a ruling! Should The Sacred Book of Truth include…",Scribe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8a,Choose a Religious Adjustment,DecisionCard,A holy tax that conveniently funds the castle’s wine fountain.,"A prophecy about a ‘Chosen One’ who, completely by coincidence, happens to be me.",tut9a,tut9a,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,Excellent. The faith economy is booming. Praise be to us.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,"So, do we do actual miracles or just tax breaks?",You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,Spontaneous miracles are unreliable. That’s why we have the High Priest of Coincidence on staff.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,My liege! A miracle! The statue of the Great Radiant One just started crying after the new tax law!,Priest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,It’s amazing what you can do with well-placed plumbing.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9a,Choosing Your First Miracle,DecisionCard,"The statue weeps? It's a sign! Pay up, or the tears turn to blood!",A miracle of kindness! Free blessed bread for all!,tut10,tut10,,,,,,,,,,
tut8b,Music controls the masses. People hum a tune long after they’ve forgotten why they were mad.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8b,So we’re sponsoring protest music?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8b,"Exactly! A controlled rebellion. Angry enough to feel rebellious, but catchy enough to keep them distracted.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8b,"I have two options: 'Down with the King' or 'Taxes, but Make It Funky.",Bard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut8b,Choose the Rebellion Soundtrack,DecisionCard,"Folk ballads. Lyrically devastating, but so slow no one has the energy to riot.","A dance craze. Wildly popular, but lyrics so vague no one’s sure what they’re mad about.",tut8c,tut8c,,,,,,,,,,
tut8c,This is either brilliant… or incredibly stupid.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tut9b
tut9b,Great news! Our protest song is a hit!,Bard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,Define 'hit',You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,People are chanting it in the streets. Nobles are furious. The baker gave me free bread. I think I'm a folk hero now.,Bard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,This is fine. As long as no one starts an actual revolution—,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,Sire! The city guards are refusing to break up protests. They like the song too much.,Guard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,That’s… unexpected.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,It has a dance now. They’re calling it The Rebellion Shuffle.,Bard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,"We have two choices: ban it and become villains, or embrace it and pretend it was our idea all along.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut9b,The Fate of the Rebellion Shuffle,DecisionCard,Ban the song. A catchy tune is one step from a guillotine.,Make it the official kingdom anthem. Rebel just enough to keep them happy.,,,,,,,,,,,Vizier,tut10
tut10,Foreign relations! The art of making friends with people you'd rather poison. Meet Ambassador Fimbleton.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,Your Majesty! An honor to serve. You seem... remarkably refreshed after your recent seclusion.,Ambassador Fimbleton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,Fimbleton knows seventeen languages and forty-three ways to insult someone with fruit arrangements.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,King Ormond of Westland wishes to meet you. Your royal cousin is quite eager for your annual... debate.,Ambassador Fimbleton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,Should I be worried?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,Only if you dislike aggressive wine tasting competitions. He's still bitter about losing last year.,Ambassador Fimbleton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut10,How to invite King Ormond?,DecisionCard,A lavish royal feast. Show our wealth.,A humble hunting trip. Easier to speak... candidly.,,,,,,,,,,,Ambassador Fimbleton,tut11
tut11,To be continued….............!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
