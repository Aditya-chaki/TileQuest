tut1a,He's inside. Don’t keep him waiting,Guard,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tut2a,"Ah, good effort. Now, just hand it",King,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH,King,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,You stare out the window. The river carries the King away. No body. No witnesses.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,Except you.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut2a,Oh. Oh no.,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3, What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,Deep breath. Walk to the door. Open it. Casually inform the guards that His Majesty has—,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,"No. Bad idea. ""Hi, the King fell out a window"" is not a great opening line.",You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,Maybe I could… flee the castle? Reinvent myself as a wandering poet? Do people tip poets?,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3, I could tie all the curtains together and rappel down the castle wall. Dignified. Graceful. Probably ends with me in the moat.,Player’s Thoughts,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3,"""Ahem.""",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut3, …Who. Was. That?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,"Well, well. A fascinating situation. A missing King. A nervous servant. A witness.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,A witness?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,"He steps out from behind the curtain, smoothing his robes. ""Yes. Me. Lucky you!",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,…Is it?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,"Absolutely! You see, I could alert the guards. They might believe I had nothing to do with this. Or…",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,Or?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut4,Or you do one little favor for me instead. A minor thing. Barely worth mentioning.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5,You can pretend to be the King.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5,How do you respond?,DecisionCard,That’s illegal!,That sounds like a terrible idea.,tut5a,tut5a,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,"Nonsense! Your blood matches, so with a little magic—"" He pulls out a suspiciously glowing wand. ""—you’ll be him.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,I don’t know how to be king. Why don’t you do it?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tut5a,What do you get out of this?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut5a,I think it'll be... fun!,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"First order of business—covering up your, uh… previous self’s unfortunate defenestration.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"Yes. That. Very tragic. How do we, uh… do that?",You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,Simple. We need a story. Something believable. Something the people will accept without question.,Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,Oh! Like ‘She ran away to follow her dream of becoming a wandering poet’?,You,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"Creative, but if we start telling people servants have dreams, we’ll have a revolution by lunchtime.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,"So, two options. One, we blame a local thief. People love a good thief-burning. Or two, we erase her family from the history books entirely. You know, if you didn’t like them.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6,How do you cover it up?,DecisionCard,Blame a local thief. Everyone hates thieves.,"Erase all members of my…her family. If I didn’t like them, they never existed.",tut6a,tut6b,,,,,,,,,
tut6a,"Ah yes, the old ‘random thief did it’ strategy. A classic. Next, we’ll say the royal treasury was stolen by ‘an unfortunate accounting error.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tut6b,"Erasing an entire bloodline. A bold move! Some would call it tyranny, but I call it... interior decorating for the royal family tree.",Vizier,,,,,,,,,,,,,
